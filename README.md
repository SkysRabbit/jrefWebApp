This project is simple web page based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Main Tasks
Through this project, users can do:
- Register and login through different users
- Add links and save to database
- Tracking urls users have visited

## Getting Started
First, create a database. We use [Neon](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects), a serverless database. 

Second, use `drizzle` to create table schema and use ORM to simplify SQL operations. 

Last, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.


## Next step
This app shows a complete function and workflow of a web app.

Almost all web apps can be developed or extended through the concept.
